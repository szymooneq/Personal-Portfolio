          <p><b>Hello! I am Szymon ðŸ‘‹</b><br /><br />Some time ago I graduated and became a computer science engineer and started developing my programming and web development skills. I am an ambitious person open to new challenges. I am passionate about programming and I associate my future with it, so I would like to develop further in this direction, learning new things and solutions and gaining new experiences. I believe that there are no things that I could not cope with, because the Internet is a treasury of knowledge and everything can be found in it, so I am able to deal with the problems I encounter by choosing the optimal solution for my goals.</p>
